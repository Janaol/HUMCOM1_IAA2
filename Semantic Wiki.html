                        <ul>Architecture is a passion, a vocation, a calling — as well as a science and a business. It has been described as a social art and also an artful science. Architecture must be of the highest quality of design. Architecture provides, in the words of Marcus Vitruvius, the great Roman architect and historian, “firmness, commodity and delight.</ul>

                Green architecture, or green design, is an approach to building that minimizes the harmful effects of construction projects on human health and the environment. The "green" architect or designer attempts to safeguard air, water, and earth by choosing eco-friendly building materials and construction practices.
                The highest goal of green architecture is to be fully sustainable. Simply put, people do "green" things in order to achieve sustainability. Some architecture, like Glenn Murcutt's 1984 Magney House, has been an experiment in green design for years.
                <br>
                <br>
                The National Institute of Building Sciences (NIBS) argues that sustainability has to be part of the whole design process, from the very start of the project. They devote an entire website to the WBDG—Whole Building Design Guide. Design objectives are interrelated, where designing for sustainability is just one aspect. "A truly successful project is one where project goals are identified early on," they write, "and where the interdependencies of all building systems are coordinated concurrently from the planning and programming phase."

                Renaissance Architecture is a style of architecture that emerged in early 15th-century Florence, Italy. Ushering in a revival of ancient Greek and Roman Classical architectural forms, it supplanted the prevailing Gothic medieval aesthetic.
                Renaissance architecture refers to the influential style of building that emerged in Florence, Italy around 1400 and spread throughout Europe over the next two centuries. Marked by a revival of ancient Classical forms, this important architectural movement produced some of the world’s most treasured monuments to civilization. 
                The Renaissance ("rebirth") spanned two centuries, encompassing not only architecture but art and human ideals, producing multi-disciplinary giants including Leonardo da Vinci and Michelangelo. The lasting cultural legacy of the Renaissance makes it one of the most transformative periods in western history.
                <br>
                <br>
                Renaissance architecture developed as part of the rebirth of classicism in Florence, Italy, circa 1400 that evolved over the next 200 years as it spread throughout Italy and then Europe. Renaissance architects in Italy took inspiration from ancient Greco-Roman ruins and early structures like the Pantheon and the Colosseum in Rome, as well as the writings of Roman architect Marcus Vitruvius Pollio (80 BC-15 BC), which were published in 1486. Rather than simply reproducing the past, Renaissance architects sought to use classical elements to innovate new structures that were rooted in history but adapted to a modern world and the development of cities. 
                <br>
                <br>
                Renaissance Architecture is generally broken down into three main periods, starting with the Early Renaissance that began around 1400 when architects began to look to antiquity for inspiration and reintroduce Classical Roman and Greek elements such as arches, columns, and domes into buildings. Early Renaissance buildings had symmetrical facades and clear, streamlined volumes that marked a change from the more complex Gothic proportions that preceded them.
                </ul>
             <p style="font-size: large; text-align: center; color: black;"><b>ROMAN ARCHITECTURE</b></p>
                <img src="https://www.ancient-origins.net/sites/default/files/field/image/Roman-architecture.jpg" width="1900" height="350">
                <ul style="font-size:medium;">
                Ancient Roman architecture used new materials, particularly concrete, and newer technologies such as the arch and the dome to make buildings that were typically strong and well-engineered. Large numbers remain in some form across the empire, sometimes complete and still in use to this day.
                Roman architecture adopted the external language of classical Greek architecture for the purposes of the ancient Romans, but was different from Greek buildings, becoming a new architectural style. The two styles are often considered one body of classical architecture. Roman architecture flourished in the Roman Republic and even more so under the Empire, when the great majority of surviving buildings were constructed, some of which the ruins remain, to which we’ve researched and learned.
                <br>
                <br>
                In Europe the Italian Renaissance saw a conscious revival of correct classical styles, initially purely based on Roman examples. Numerous local classical styles developed, such as Palladian architecture, Georgian architecture and Regency architecture in the English-speaking world, Federal architecture in the United States, and later Stripped Classicism and PWA Moderne.
                Roman influences may be found around us today, in banks, government buildings, great houses, and even small houses, perhaps in the form of a porch with Doric columns and a pediment or in a fireplace or a mosaic shower floor derived from a Roman original, often from Pompeii or Herculaneum. The mighty pillars, dome and arches of Rome echo in the New World too, where in Washington, D.C. stand the Capitol building, the White House, the Lincoln Memorial, and other government buildings. All across the US the seats of regional government were normally built in the grand traditions of Rome, with vast flights of stone steps sweeping up to towering pillared porticoes, with huge domes gilded or decorated inside with the same or similar themes that were popular in Rome.
                <br>
                <br>
                While borrowing much from the preceding Etruscan architecture, such as the use of hydraulics and the construction of arches, Roman prestige architecture remained firmly under the spell of Ancient Greek architecture and the classical orders. This came initially from Magna Graecia, the Greek colonies in southern Italy, and indirectly from Greek influence on the Etruscans, but after the Roman conquest of Greece directly from the best classical and Hellenistic examples in the Greek world. The influence is evident in many ways; for example, in the introduction and use of the Triclinium in Roman villas and terraces as a place and manner of dining. Roman builders employed Greeks in many capacities, especially in the great boom in construction in the early Empire.
                </ul>
             <p style="font-size: large; text-align: center; color: black;"><b>MODERN ARCHITECTURE</b></p>
                <img src="https://www.bocadolobo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/modern-architecture.jpg" width="1900" height="350">
                <ul style="font-size:medium;">
                The dawn of modern architecture came at a time when hand-labored craftsmanship was being replaced with machine-made industrialization. Modern architects worked to reinvent ways of building that focused more on how humans lived versus what they found beautiful. This architecture is not sentimental, like revivalist styles. Instead, it is innovative, experimental, and minimal. 
                Modern architecture is a style of building that emphasizes function and a streamlined form over ornamentation. This design aesthetic is a departure from more elaborate and decorated homes like Queen Anne, Victorian, or Gothic Revival styles. Modern architecture usually involves sharp, clean lines.
                <br>
                <br>
                The modern movement was not short-lived, and it encompasses several sub-styles that span nearly 60 years. In this way, it can be difficult to pinpoint an exact starting point. To some, the style includes more transitional architecture like the Art Deco and Arts and Crafts movements. To others, those earlier styles served as inspiration for more "pure," mid-century modern architects.
                The birth of modern design came with the thought that form should follow function. This idea started with architect Louis Sullivan who designed buildings for the 1893 Chicago World Fair. That mantra became the foundation for modern architects.
                <br>
                <br>
                Earlier styles of modern architecture still had some use of ornamentation. For instance, Frank Lloyd Wright would incorporate art glass windows so that no additional artwork was needed. Beyond that, modern architecture is mostly analytical and not showy. 
                To some people, modern and contemporary architecture are the same thing. However, modern architecture was inspired by an art movement known as modernism and lasted until around 1960. Contemporary architecture incorporates architecture past the 1960s and leading up to today. In short, contemporary architecture is reflective of styles in this current moment, which happen to be very diverse.
