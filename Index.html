            <h2>SELENAIA ARCHITECTS</h2>
            <p>Sergey Makhno is a modern Ukrainian designer, founder, and director of Sergey Makhno Architects.

                Sergey Makhno graduated from Kyiv National University of Construction and Architecture and from Academic 
                School of Design in Moscow. In 2003, intuitively understanding that future lies in design.
                <br><br>
                Now, Sergey Makhno creates collections of unique objects, successfully builds houses, hotels and cottage towns, implements 
                interior spaces for apartments, restaurants, offices, and boutiques with his personally designed furniture and décor elements,
                and engages in social projects. The main directions for Makhno Architects are contemporary minimalism, eclecticism, and loft styles.
                <br><br>
                By the age of thirty-three, Sergey Makhno had conducted his first personal exhibition of interior design objects from a limited series
                 “Life of Ideas”. In addition, with this exhibition, the designer presented a same-named book and a movie.</p>

            <h2>NOCTURNAL ARCHITECTURE</h2>
            <p>As artificial lighting became a thing of the 19th and 20th centuries, architects were fast enough to employ it as 
                an element incorporated into the design of high-rise buildings. At the same time, new technologies, indeed, enabled 
                construction of higher and higher buildings. Skyscrapers started to include lights from the building's interior, as well 
                as additional lights on the face or its outlining elements, became trending the same.
                <br><br>
                This trend became known as the architecture of the night, or nocturnal architecture, where the emphasis was heavily put 
                on the night lighting. Architects even started to use lights deliberately and soon most high-rise buildings and commercial
                 edifices provided a new face to city lights. This architectural characteristic persisted through the 1920s and 1930s, and then,
                  it was revived once again through the 1950s and 1960s.

                <h3>Helix Bridge, Singapore</h3>
                <p>The design consortium is an international team comprising Australian architects the Cox Architecture and engineers Arup, 
                    and Singapore based Architects 61.The Land Transport Authority claimed it is a world first in architectural and engineering
                    bridge design. It won the 'World's Best Transport Building' award at the World
                    Architecture Festival Awards in the same year.
                    <br><br>
                    Canopies (made of fritted-glass and perforated steel mesh) are incorporated along parts of 
                    the inner spiral to provide shade for pedestrians. The bridge has four viewing platforms
                    sited at strategic locations which provide stunning views of the Singapore skyline and
                    events taking place within Marina Bay.At night, the bridge will be illuminated by a 
                    series of lights that highlight the double-helix structure, thereby creating a special
                    visual experience for the visitors.</p>

                <h3>Busan Cinema Center, South Korea</h3>
                <p>Architecture and Cinema - the Main Roof – The dynamic LED lighting surface covering the undulating ceilings of the outdoor 
                    roof canopies gives the Busan Cinema Center its iconographic feature. Artistic lighting programs tailored to 
                    events of the BIFF or the Municipality of Busan can be created by visual artists and displayed across the
                    ceiling in full motion graphics. Imbedded in the architecture the lighting surfaces serve as a communication
                     platform for the content of the Busan Cinema Center and create a memorable atmosphere.
                    <br><br>
                    The Double Cone is the symbolic landmark entrance element to the Busan Cinema Center and connects the
                     Cinema Mountain and the BIFF Hill. The Double Cone also is the only vertical structural support for the 
                     large cantilevered roof acting as a large, singular column.

                <h3>Beijing National Aquatics Center, China</h3>
                <p>Comprising a steel space frame, it is the largest ETFE-clad structure in the world with over 100,000 m² 
                    of ETFE pillows that are only 0.2 mm (1/125 of an inch) in total thickness. The ETFE cladding,
                    supplied and installed by the firm Vector Foiltec, allows more light and heat penetration than traditional glass, 
                    resulting in a 30% decrease in energy costs. This choice was made in view of Beijing's goal of presenting a fully 
                    "green" Olympic Games, with zero net growth in total carbon emissions. 
                    <br><br>
                    The outer wall is based on the Weaire-Phelan structure, a structure devised from the natural pattern of bubbles in soap lather.
                    In the true Weaire-Phelan structure the edge of each cell is curved in order to maintain 109.5 degree angles at each vertex 
                    (satisfying Plateau's rules), but of course as a structural support system each beam was required to be straight so as to better resist axial 
                    compression. </p>
